AcVis (Actors Smart Visualizer)

It is the representation of a Web tool for flexible visualization of data related to the nominations 
of actors at the Screen Actors Guide (SAG) Awards via a proprietary REST/GraphQL API. Additional information 
about each actor and film production is retrieved through The Movie Database (TMDb). The generated statistics 
and visualizations - at least 3 ways - can be exported in CSV, WebP and SVG formats. The system also offers 
support for the playback of privileged news for each individual nominee, based on external data sources that 
can be configured within the developed application.
